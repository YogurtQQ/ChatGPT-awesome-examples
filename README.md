#### Explain in the github README.md, what the repository is about, how I'm storing examples of the ChatGPT AI that I found interesting:

The purpose of this repository is to showcase examples of the ChatGPT AI that I found interesting. In this repository, you will find different examples of the use of ChatGPT AI model, including but not limited to:

- Dialogue generation
- Text completion
- Language translation
- Language generation

All examples will be organized in a readable and easily understandable format with the necessary explanations and resources.

The examples are stored in the form of Jupyter notebook, python scripts or plain text files along with any additional files required to run the examples.

The repository also includes a README.md file in each example directory that provides a brief explanation of the example and instructions on how to run it.

The examples are intended to be used as a starting point for understanding how to use the ChatGPT AI model and how it can be integrated into various applications. The focus of the repository is on providing an understanding of the working of the model, rather than on the specific application.

The examples in this repository are not meant to be exhaustive but to provide a comprehensive understanding of ChatGPT AI model by showing its capabilities and limitations.

Please keep in mind that the examples use OpenAI GPT-3 which is a proprietary model and it may require OpenAI API key to use it.

I hope you find the examples in this repository helpful and informative.
